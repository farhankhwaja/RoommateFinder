* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) as the server platform.
* [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) as the frontend framework.
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) as the web framework.

### Additional Tools

* [Bower](http://bower.io/) as package manager for web
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.
* [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) mongodb node.js driver in charge of providing elegant mongodb object modeling for node.js

These are some of the advantages of a MEAN stack:

- Single language is used in the whole application
- Support for the MVC pattern
- JSON is used for transfering data
- Node.js's huge module library
- Open source so you can tweak it to your preferences if you're an experienced user
